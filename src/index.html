    <p>Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[6] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[7][8][9] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[10] He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas and was mostly of English descent, though in 2007 it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the US in 1850.[11] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[12][13] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1934–1982),[14][15] was a married[16][17][18] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[16][19] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[20][21] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[22][23]  </p>
